### Abstract
We are, as group of exchange students at INSA Lyon, making a computer science SMART project around a topic with social impacts. Our project is a website that educates people about how same topics are covered by newspapers around the world.

## Description 
We started with the topic of the crises happening in Palestine currently. We selected a significant and timely topic that demands more discussion around it and has profound societal impacts.
We are making a website with a search bar for inputting any keyword and a interactive map that visualizes and informs people about news from different countries. We are not just giving users news but also providing sentiment analysis, key word clustering, different filters (like biased, netral, good, bad news) and fect checking.

## Project Goal
Our main goal is to educate users and provide a platform that compares different point-of-views of the same events by showing news and articles from different countries. That way, we would avoid spreading information in a biased way that favors certain interpretations/opinions over others and also make the user aware of how a particular event can have different interpretations around the world. 
We wish to contribute to discussion about the humanitarian crises in Gaza. We will provide objective information for the users while standing on the side of peace. As a group, our own goal is also to deepen our understanding of the conflict and its impacts. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a part of our project as it is one of the topics we suggest for the user on the website.
We are aiming to create a site that would be a reachable source of knowledge for adults and adolescents. We wish to contribute to adding critical thinking.

## Requirements
Web design and good usability
Multimedia support
Possibilities to check reliability of sources - access to original articles
Fact checking model 
Sentimental analysis model
Other analysis on the articles
Database connection but also fresh news articles from API everytime you do a search

## Material
APIs & map data
Templates for programming
HTML, CSS, Typescript
Angular project
Python
Sqlite database
Flask app

## State of Art of Israeli-Palestine conflict related sources
The OCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) has a website https://www.ochaopt.org/ that displays different Israeli-Palestine conflict data. Such as the number of Israelis and Palestinians deaths, injuries, people displaced, etc. https://acleddata.com/israel-palestine/

There are some mobile apps surrounding the same topic on the App Store. An app “iPalestine” includes an interactive map that shows Israeli activities that affect the Palestinian surrounding, for example roadblocks, the separation wall and land confiscation. It lacks real-time updated data and data about bombings & attacks on the map. It has news but mostly just in Arabic so it’s not accessible for English-speakers or other people who belong to our target group. An app “Palestine News & Radio - Gaza Palestinian Updates” provides news about the conflict in English but it doesn’t have an interactive map.

Donating: Operation Olive Branch (linktr.ee/opolivebranch), they have collected the GoFundMe accounts of the Palestinian families in Gaza needing financial help to survive. Many other people and organizations have done campaigns on social media to raise funds to help Palestinians. Overall, social media has been a channel for many people to find information about the crises.
