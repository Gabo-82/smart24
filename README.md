Project [SMART(PLD)](riccardotommasini.com/teaching/smart) is provided by [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/).

### Abstract
We are, as group of exchange students at INSA Lyon, making a computer science SMART project around a topic with social impacts. Our project is a website that educates people about what's happening in Palestine and how newspapers talk about it.

## Description 
We have selected a significant and timely topic that demands more discussion around it and has profound societal impacts. Our topic is the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict.
We are making a website with an interactive map that visualizes and informs people about the events and news around the conflict. We are not just giving users news from different news outlets but also making structure, classification or some kind of clustering of the news, for example clustering based on time or region.
During the project, we will be doing research about the conflict and it's timeline by reading articles. We will do research on the reliability of the sources of our data.

## Project Goal
Our main goal is to educate users and provide a platform that compares different point-of-views of the same events by showing news and articles from different countries. That way, we would avoid spreading information in a biased way that favors certain interpretations/opinions over others and also make the user aware of how a particular event can have different interpretations around the world. 
We wish to contribute to discussion about the humanitarian crises in Gaza. We will provide objective information for the users while standing on the side of peace. As a group, our own goal is also to deepen our understanding of the conflict and its impacts.
The goal of the website is to inform people about the seriousness of the conflict and the actual events but also the way different news outlets talk about it. We are aiming to create a site that would be a reachable source of knowledge for adults and adolescents.

## Requirements
Responsive web design and good usability
Multimedia support
Possibilities to check reliability of sources
Possibility to find the original news articles (their url addresses)

## Material
News APIs & map data
Timeline of the conflict, main events
Templates for programming
HTML, CSS, Typescript


## State of Art
The OCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) has a website https://www.ochaopt.org/ that displays different Israeli-Palestine conflict data. Such as the number of Israelis and Palestinians deaths, injuries, people displaced, etc. https://acleddata.com/israel-palestine/

There are some mobile apps surrounding the same topic on the App Store. An app “iPalestine” includes an interactive map that shows Israeli activities that affect the Palestinian surrounding, for example roadblocks, the separation wall and land confiscation. It lacks real-time updated data and data about bombings & attacks on the map. It has news but mostly just in Arabic so it’s not accessible for English-speakers or other people who belong to our target group. An app “Palestine News & Radio - Gaza Palestinian Updates” provides news about the conflict in English but it doesn’t have an interactive map.

Donating: Operation Olive Branch (linktr.ee/opolivebranch), they have collected the GoFundMe accounts of the Palestinian families in Gaza needing financial help to survive. Many other people and organizations have done campaigns on social media to raise funds to help Palestinians. Overall, social media has been a channel for many people to find information about the crises.
